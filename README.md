2. Run 'matrix.python'
3. Enter the name of the 6 files.
   - **Note:** Make sure that you first input file name that contains the Outer Velocity data, then enter file name that contains the Inner Velocity data. [Sample Input Below].
    - **Sample Input:** Array1.csv [Enter] Array1inner.csv [Enter] Array2.csv [Enter] Array2inner.csv [Enter] Array3.csv [Enter] Array3inner.csv [Enter]
4. Once the 6 files have been entered without any error. Input file name where the matrixs will be stored.
     - **Sample Input:** Matrix.csv
5. Done!
